This is a simple, clean Instagram Profile Grid UI Clone built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. The goal of this project is to turn a static design into accessible, modern code â€” and make it easy for anyone to customize or learn from. Itâ€™s mobile responsive and includes a CSS Grid layout.

_This project is free and open-source, and focused on helping new frontend developers practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript with real-world examples._
